XML -> Application Object

Request -> View

Data -> Object or functions?  Can we have something generic here.

Custom logic -> how does it fit in?

##Requests Process
1. request comes in
2. View processes request and gets section, question_group, question from Application object?  When should the data be bound to this?  
3. Bind data to Application object in data layer.
4. Custom logic called wherever needed?
